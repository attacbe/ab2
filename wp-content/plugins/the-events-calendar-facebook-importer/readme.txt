Import events into The Events Calendar from a Facebook organization or page.

== Description ==

With the Facebook Events add-on, you can tap into the growing number of events Facebook users are organizing by importing public events from a specific organization or page directly into your WordPress site.

Import individual Facebook events into <a href="http://m.tri.be/2x">The Events Calendar</a>, or choose to bulk import them from Facebook organization(s) or page(s) that you define. Imported events are automagically created as entries in The Events Calendar. Basic event data along with venue & organizer are populated appropriately. No more entering information in two places, or having to recreate someone else‚Äôs listing for a public event you want to include on your WordPress calendar.

Make sure to get the free <a href="http://m.tri.be/2x">The Events Calendar</a> plugin first.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. Q: What is the Facebook App ID and App Secret, and where do I find them?

A: Facebook requires a Facebook App ID and App Secret to access data via the Facebook graph API in order to import your events from Facebook. Provided with the plugin is a default set of API credentials, however we encourage you to create your own Facebook App and enter your credentials on the settings page. For more, please see this tutorial: http://m.tri.be/2y.

2. Q: Where can I find a user's or page's username or ID?

A user's username or ID can be found in the URL used to access his or her profile. For example https://www.facebook.com/zuck is the URL used to access Mark Zuckerberg's profile. His username is 'zuck'. If a user doesn't have a username, you will see his or her ID (numerical)in the URL for his profile. The same concept applies to pages, you can find their username or ID in their URL. Modern Tribe's Page is https://www.facebook.com/ModernTribeInc and the username is 'ModernTribeInc'. You can also find the ID of a user or page by visiting the Graph API. For example, to find Modern Tribe's ID, visit https://graph.facebook.com/ModernTribeInc. You will get a json response with information about the user or page. The first result should be the ID.

3. Q: Where can I find an event's Facebook ID?

A: You can determine an event's Facebook ID by looking at the URL of the event. For example, the ID of this event: https://www.facebook.com/events/12345689 would be 123456789

4. Q: Where can I get support if I encounter problems or bugs?

A: Please visit the Facebook Events support forum at <a href="http://m.tri.be/2z">http://m.tri.be/2z.</a>

IMPORTANT NOTICE: 3.11 is a massive update from the 3.9 build, which contains a number of changes under-the-hood.
